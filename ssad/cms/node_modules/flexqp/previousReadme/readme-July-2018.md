## Introduction

### Objective
- The Company -  FLEX-SOLVER PTE LTD

To create a clean and standardized format for mysql query call when writing APIs.

Hence, this library was created on top of the [OFFICIAL MYSQL LIBRARY](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql#introduction). 

We recommend you to try out mysql library first before you start with this wrapper.

### Features
- Connect to Mysql database.
- Easy query to the database.
- Easy parse data from the database withuot introducing models.

## Important Notes 
### Important Notes #1 -About Promise (Latest 20/05/2018)

In this library, most of the functions return promises. We highly encourage developers to practice on [await-async (read me to find out why).](https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9)

### Important Notes #2 -About Returns (Latest 20/05/2018)

As mentioned, the library is written on top of the offical library, we only did very minimum changes in the returned data to ease the data parsing.

Apart from that, you may refer to 
1. [JSON Data Type](#json-data-type)
2. [Timestamp Data Type](#timestamp-data-type)



## Installation
This is a Node.js module available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, download and install Node.js. Node.js 8.0 or higher is required.

Installation is done using the npm install command:

```
$ npm install flexqp
```

## Define Connection

The recommended way to define connection is to create a json file like this:

```
{

    "host" : "localhost",
    "user" : "admin",
    "password" : "p@55w0rd",
    "database" : "world"    
}

```

Alternatively, you can also create an connection object which serve the same purpose upon establishing connection like this:

```
let dbConnection = {
    host : "localhost",
    user : "admin",
    password : "p@55w0rd",
    database : "world"    
}
```
In order to standardize the code in the following example, we will use the first method by using: `require('dbConnection.json');` 




## Syntax Introduction

You can simply find out the purpose of all APIs using the defination table here:

Syntax  | Definition | :star:
------------- | ------------- | -------------
`execute`  | Send this SQL query to the database | :star::star::star::star::star:
`AndFetch`  | Perform a `select` or `call` statement call | :star::star::star::star:
`Update`  | Perform `update`, `delete`, `insert` statement call | :star::star::star::star:
`First`  | Retrieve the `first result` if exists else `null` | :star::star::star:
`Promise`  | This returns as a promise | :star::star::star::star::star:
`Ignore`  | Even if this query did not pass, this Promise will always resolves by itself | :star::star:
~~`End`~~  | ~~Straight away end the http request~~ (Consider to deprecate this soon) | :star:

## Methods Introduction

 Method Name  | Usage 
------------- | -------------
`presetConnection`  | [Preset Connection](#preset-connection) 
`executeAndFetchPromise`  | Perform a `select` or `call` statement call 
`executeAndFetchFirstPromise`  | Perform a `select` or `call` statement call and return the first result 
`executeUpdatePromise`  | Perform a query and returns database result such as affected rows, insertId back 
`executeUpdateIgnorePromise`  | Perform a query and returns database result or error object back 

## Preset Connection
If you will only be using `one database` and `one connection`, you are recommended to preset connection upon running the server. 

With the preset connection, you no longer need to define your connection before you perform any sql query call via the following example:
```
var qp = require('flexqp');
var dbConnection = require('./dbConnection.json');
qp.presetConnection(dbConnection);

```

Just remember this, If you did not declare the database connection in the following method, this library will always be using the default/preset configuration for you.

In another word, you are not required to define database credential after you have preset the connection.

## Retrieve From Database
If you would like to write a function that performs select statement, you may do it as the following example.

```
var qp = require('flexqp');
var dbConnection = require('./dbConnection.json');
qp.presetConnection(dbConnection);


async function getUsers(){
    //select the whole array of users
   var result1 = await qp.executeAndFetchPromise('select * from users');
   return result1;
}

async function getActiveUsers(){
    //select the whole array of active users
   var result2 = await qp.executeAndFetchPromise('select * from users where status = ?', ['ACTIVE']);
    return result2;
}

async function getSpecific(_name){
    //select a specific user
   var result3 = await qp.executeAndFetchFirstPromise('select * from users where name like ?', [_name]);
    return result3;
}

```

## Insert, Update and Delete
If you would like to write a function that performs insert/update/delete statement, you may do it as the following example.

```
var qp = require('flexqp');
var dbConnection = require('./dbConnection.json');
qp.presetConnection(dbConnection);


async function insertUser(user){
    //select the whole array of users
   var result1 = await qp.executeUpdatePromise('insert into users set ?', [user]);
   return result1;
}

async function updateUser(user, originalId){
    //select the whole array of active users
   var result2 = await qp.executeUpdatePromise('update users set ? where id = ?', [user, originalId]);
    return result2;
}

async function deleteUser(_name){
    //select a specific user
   var result3 = await qp.executeUpdatePromise('delete from users where name like ?', [_name]);
    return result3;
}

```
